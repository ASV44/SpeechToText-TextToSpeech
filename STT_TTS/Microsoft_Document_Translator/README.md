# Microsoft Document Translator
The Microsoft Document Translator translates Microsoft Office, plain text, HTML and PDF files, from any of the 50 languages supported by the Microsoft Translator web service, to any other of these 50 languages.
Document Translator uses the customer's own credentials and subscription to perform the service, and will make use of any translation stored in the Collaborative Translations Framework,
as well as making use of a custom MT system, trained via the Microsoft Translator Hub (https://hub.microsofttranslator.com).

### Command line operation
Document Translator can be run from the command line:

Translate documents:

`DocumentTranslatorCmd translatedocuments /documents:d:\testdocuments\*.docx /from:en /to:de,el`

*When a wildcard is given, Document Translator recurses through subdirectories.


Set credentials:

`DocumentTranslatorCmd setcredentials /clientid:ClientId /clientsecret:ClientSecret`

Upload a TMX to the Collaborative Translation Framework for use in subsequent translations:

`DocumentTranslatorCmd tmxtoctf /tmx:TmxFileName.tmx /from:FromLanguage /to:ToLanguage /user:UserName /rating:Rating /write:true`

*When write is not set to true, the results of the TMX parse are rendered to the screen. It is advisable to perform the
test without write set to true in order to debug the TMX content. WARNING: Use only bilingual TMX. Document Translator performs no validation of the TMX content languages.*

Get Word Alignments

`DocumentTranslatorCmd getalignments /documents:test.txt /from:en /to:fr`

Builds a CSV file containing 3 columns: source, target, and word alignment information in the format 

[[SourceTextStartIndex]:[SourceTextEndIndex]–[TgtTextStartIndex]:[TgtTextEndIndex]] *

for every word of the source. The information for each word is separated by a space, including for non-space-separated languages (scripts) like Chinese. 
Example alignment string: "0:0-7:10 1:2-11:20 3:4-0:3 3:4-4:6 5:5-21:21".

In other words, the colon separates start and end index, the dash separates the languages, and space separates the words.
One word may align with zero, one, or multiple words in the other language, and the aligned words may be non-contiguous.
When no alignment information is available, the Alignment element will be empty. No error.
